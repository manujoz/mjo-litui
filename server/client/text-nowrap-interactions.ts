// Text Nowrap Client-side interactions
// This file handles any client-side functionality for the mjo-text-nowrap demo page

// Since mjo-text-nowrap is a simple utility component focused on CSS truncation,
// there are no interactive features that require client-side JavaScript.
// This file is kept minimal for consistency with other component demos.

console.log("mjo-text-nowrap demo page loaded - no interactive features");

// If in the future we add interactive features like:
// - Toggle full text visibility
// - Dynamic content changes
// - Accessibility enhancements
// They would be implemented here following the same pattern as other component demos.
